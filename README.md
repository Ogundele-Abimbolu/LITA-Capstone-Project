## Project Overview
This project is part of the LITA Capstone, where we aim to extract meaningful insights from sales data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The insights are expected to support business decisions by identifying trends, top-selling products, and regional sales performance.


## Tools Used:
* Excel for data exploration
* SQL for querying and analysis
* Power BI for interactive data visualization


# Data Analysis
## Excel Analysis
Initial data exploration and calculations were performed in Excel. Key steps included:

* ## Pivot Tables:
     * Created pivot tabled to display:
       * Total Sales by Product: To identify high-performing products.
       * Sales by Region: To determine regional demand.
       * Monthly Sales Trends: To identify seasonality in sales.
* ## Calculations:
     * Used Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as:
        * Average Sales per Product: Provides a benchmark for product performance.
        * Total Revenue by Region: To see which regions contributed most to revenue.
* ## Additional Reports:
     * Analyzed top-selling products using filtering options in the pivot tables.


# SQL Analysis
Further insights were gathered using SQL queries to address specific business questions. Here are the queries used and the insights they provided:

1. Total Sales by Product Category:
   
```SQL
SELECT product_category, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product_category;
```
 * Insight: Helps in understanding which product categories generate the most revenue.

2. Number of Sales Transactions in Each Region:

```SQL
SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```
 * Insight: Shows the volume of sales across different regions, helping in resource allocation.

3. Highest-Selling Product by Total Sales Value:

```SQL
SELECT product, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;  -- Or use TOP 1 for SQL Server
```
 * Insight: Identifies the single highest-performing product by sales value.

4. Total Revenue per Product:

```SQL
SELECT product, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product;
```
 * Insight: Shows the revenue generated by each product.
